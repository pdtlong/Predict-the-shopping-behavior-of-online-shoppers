# Buidling a Classification model to predict the shopping behavior of online shoppers.

This is a binary classification model used to classify customer behavior on social networks to predict their buying ability which focuses on customer data processing and analysis methods including:

- Data preprocessing (cleaning, normalizing in both numerical and categorical form).
- Select melon features based on the method named MRMR
- Build classification model based on 3 different methods:
**MLP, C4.5 Decision Tree** and **Random Forest**

### Required Libraries:
- Python 3.7
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn

### Some libraries have been attached
- **mRMR** (Serving ranking and feature selection)
- **c45_tree_classifier** (model)
